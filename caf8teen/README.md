# Caf8teen

Caf8teen is a software package that runs a LED lighting installation in Cafe 18 at Facebook's Menlo Park headquarters. Using the Processing framework, it drives algorithmic patterns across a grid of independently addressable LED nodes.

## Installation
 * Install Processing, available at http://processing.org
 * Unzip external/HeronLX.zip and install into the folder ~/Documents/Processing/libraries/HeronLX (or just run install-lx.sh)
 * Open Caf8teen/Caf8teen.pde in Processing

You may need to restart Processing after an update to refresh the source and libraries.
