		<string>Note: munkitools does not include a code signature. If your
organization requires code signature, it is recommend to internally sign
the application.

Downloads and imports version 3 of the Munki tools via
the official releases listing on GitHub. You can set INCLUDE_PRERELEASES
to any value to have this recipe pull prerelease versions.

Note that Munki 3 includes an additional component pkg, munkitools_app_usage.
This recipe imports this to the Munki with the appropriate 'requires' key,
however as it is considered an optional component, this recipe does not
add it as an update_for any Munki component. Admins should add
munkitools_app_usage to a manifest manually if its installation on clients
is desired.

This recipe cannot be overridden to pull a download from an
alternate location such as munkibuilds.org - it will only download the
official releases. For this, use the munkitools2-autobuild.munki
recipe with a manually-provided DOWNLOAD_URL variable.

The GitHubReleasesInfoProvider processor used by this recipe also
respects an input variable: 'sort_by_highest_tag_names', which
if set, will ignore the post dates of the releases and instead sort
descending by tag names according to LooseVersion semantics.

MUNKI_ICON should be overridden with your icon name.
