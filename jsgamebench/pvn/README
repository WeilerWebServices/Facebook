Overview
--------
Pirates vs Ninjas is a physics based game where the pirates try to knock down the ninjas
dojo by launching cannonball-pirates at them. The code style has some oddity to it because
it was two projects grafted together. It runs on both mobile and desktop.

It uses the code in the engine/ directory for rendering and input (this code is a stripped
down version of the same code from https://github.com/facebook/jsgamebench )

Installation
------------
Place the pvn/ and engine/ directories into any webserver that can host static HTML files.

Then, create a new Facebook Application, and set the fb_app_id in index.html to your app_id.
