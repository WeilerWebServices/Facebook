Overview
--------
Pirate Chess is a multiplayer game that uses facebook requests instead of a server.
Once you make a move and challenge some of your friends, the state of the board is
stored in the request and passed back and forth. It runs on both mobile and desktop.

It uses the code in the engine/ directory for rendering and input (this code is a stripped
down version of the same code from https://github.com/facebook/jsgamebench )

Installation
------------
Place the chess/ and engine/ directories into any webserver that can host static HTML files.

Then, create a new Facebook Application, and set the fb_app_id in index.html to your app_id.
