echo "please read the stop-server script before use"

# if you are using the cassandra start script with -p, this
# is the best way to stop:

# kill `cat <pidfile>` 


# otherwise, you can run something like this, but
# this is a shotgun approach and will kill other processes
# with cassandra in their name or arguments too:

# user=`whoami`
# pgrep -u $user -f cassandra | xargs kill
