Instuctions on how to build Mozilla .a libraries
================================================

1. Download and install packages in this order, as they have dependencies:

   - pkg-config-0.20.tar.gz
   - glib-2.14.6.tar.gz
   - atk-1.9.1.tar.bz2
   - freetype-2.3.4.tar.gz
   - fontconfig-2.3.97.tar.gz
   - cairo-1.2.6.tar.gz
   - tiff-3.7.4.tar.gz
   - pango-1.18.4.tar.gz
   - gtk+-2.10.13.tar.gz
   - libIDL-0.8.8.tar.gz

2. Download and install Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.4

   firefox-2.0.0.4-source.tar.bz2

3. When make completes, there will be .h files compiled from IDL files, and
   there will be .a files compiled in different sub-directories. A "find -name"
   can easily collect them and flatten them into one single directory like
   include/ and lib/ libfbml has. As time of writing this, ALL .h files are
   collected, as there is no harm having extra unincluded header files, but
   only referenced .a libraries are collected. See libfbml/Makefile for the
   list of .a libraries that are needed.

4. These are directly copied directories and sources are modified since:

   html/  <=  mozilla/parser/htmlparser/src
   css/   <=  mozilla/layout/style
   js/    <=  mozilla/js/src
