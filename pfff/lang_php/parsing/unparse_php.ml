(*****************************************************************************)
(* Prelude *)
(*****************************************************************************)
(*
 * There are multiple ways to unparse PHP code:
 *  - one can iterate over the AST, and print its leaves, but 
 *    comments and spaces are not in the AST so you need
 *    some extra code that also visits the tokens and try to "sync" the
 *    visit of the AST with the tokens
 *  - one can iterate over the tokens which contain comments and spaces
 *    but this can be too low level
 *  - one can use a real pretty printer with a boxing or backtracking model
 *    working on a AST extended with comments (see julien's ast_pretty_print/)
 * 
 * Right now the preferred method for spatch is the second one. The pretty
 * printer currently is too different from our coding conventions
 * (also because we don't have precise coding conventions).
 * This token-based unparser handles transfo annotations (Add/Remove).
 * 
 * related: the sexp/json "exporters".
 * 
 * note: this module could be in analyze_php/ instead of parsing_php/, 
 * but it's maybe good to have the basic parser/unparser together.
 *)

(*****************************************************************************)
(* Unparsing using AST visitor *)
(*****************************************************************************)

(* This will not preserve spaces and comments but it's useful
 * and good enough for printing small chunk of PHP code for debugging
 * purpose. We also try to preserve the line numbers.
