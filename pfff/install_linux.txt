To build pfff you will need several development packages usually
not shipped in a default install.

Install gtk2-devel, atk-devel, pango-devel, and cairo-devel,
swi-prolog, ncurses-devel, and binutils-gold.

For instance:
for RedHat: sudo yum install gtk2-devel
for Gentoo: sudo emerge gtk2
for Arch: I don't remember

For Ubuntu/Debian, packages are named differently, usually with a 'lib'
prefix, so you will want to install:
libgtk2.0-dev, libcairo2-dev, libpango1.0-dev and finally
the binutils-gold package.

On Fedora you may need to install the camlp4 packages too: 
 ocaml-camlp4 ocaml-camlp4-devel
You'll also need to install perl-pod-usage to be able to run configure itself.

Then:
  $ ./configure
  $ make depend
  $ make
  $ make opt
