need yum install pcre-devel, gdbm-devel before installing
ocsigenserver. Then opam install eliom should do everything.

I'm using Eliom right now only to pass marshalled object conveniently
to the (js_of_ocaml compiled) client via the %xxx camlp4 extension.
I try to minimize the number of .eliom file given that tools
such as eliomdep do not work very well.



old: On my devbox recent version of ocamlnet don't compile, so you'll have
to 'opam install ocamlnet.3.6.5'
