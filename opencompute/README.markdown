# Open Compute Project

Welcome to our beta Git repository. In it you will find specs in multimarkdown for our Intel and AMD V2 motherboard Incubation Projects, as well as a preliminary spec for the Open Rack Incubation Project and a charter for the Open Hardware Management Incubation Project. Mechanical CAD files will be forthcoming. We also have a small project, called Alpha, for converting multimarkdown specs into multi-page pdfs. It is non-functional until the instructions for installing all the latex tools are documented.

One thing to note: the OCP logos for HTML and PDF generation are in /alpha/images. You will need to manually symlink the images in there to a particular project's images folder. The gitmmd2pdf.py script will do this for you, but this script won't generate nice output or compile unless you have all the latex tools installed.
